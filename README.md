hlog
====

`hlog` is my from-the-ground-up blog. It is titled under the theory that
software that is unpleasant to use should be unpleasant to pronounce. It is
expected that further revisions of this software will add more consonants to
the title; for example, `hglog` or `schplog`. This scheme is chosen for its
clear advantages over semantic versioning.

Features
--------

Currently, this blog implements just the most basic, fundamental feature of
any blogging platform. On receipt of an HTTP GET request to "/" (or, for that
matter, any TCP request of any kind whatsoever), it responds with the message
"Piss off."
